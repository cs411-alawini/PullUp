## Project Title
Pull Up

## Project Summary

Project Summary: Pull Up is a web app designed to connect (UIUC) students with fraternity and RSO  events on campus. It fills the gap in the existing UIUC event-tracking landscape because of its emphasis on student-led events. We will manually input initial event data and populate the database with simulated data to create a functional prototype.
